                Exploring new places, whether far or nearby, is something many of us love. But before the fun starts, there's always planning. According to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), there were 1.5 billion international tourists in 2021, while domestic tourism accounted for a whopping 8 billion trips. However, the process from planning a trip to embarking on it is often filled with stress and anxiety.

                A 2022 survey by Skift revealed that a significant 70% of respondents found holiday planning stressful. With such a significant portion of people feeling overwhelmed by the searching & planning process, there's an evident need for a streamlined solution.
